        <a href="#bouie">Is America no longer governable?</a> <a href="#psychedelics">Can psychedelics cure us?</a> <a href="#leibowitz">What’s in a Subway tuna fish sandwich?</a> This December, Times Opinion is looking back at the most important — and absurd — debates of 2021. From the urgent conversations we had as a nation to the minor controversies that fascinated us, these are the things that got people talking, and talking, and talking … on Twitter, in the halls of Congress, on campus and at work. Taken together, the 41 responses in this package create a timeline of the year in opinion; we hope they make you think, laugh and discuss, and maybe, just maybe, one of them will change your mind.

            <p>In the summer, I found myself at a party on a Washington  rooftop, wedged in tight among my fellow coastal elites — journalists, congressional staff members, lawyers, wonks. One of the most prominent establishment intellectuals in the country happened to be standing nearby, holding forth. So I did what any self-respecting person would do in my situation: I eavesdropped. “In this country, we have lost the shared architecture of reality,” he said. </p><p>His argument, which was ubiquitous in 2021, was that Americans have lost a common worldview because we no longer have the necessary infrastructure to produce one: news sources trusted by nearly everyone. What else could explain the conspiracism linking Jan. 6 rioters and Covid anti-vaxxers except a reality crisis — a state of affairs in which Republicans and Democrats have come to occupy separate worlds of fact? Kevin Roose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/02/technology/biden-reality-crisis-misinformation.html">warned</a> in February that “unless the Biden administration treats conspiracy theories and disinformation as the urgent threats they are, our parallel universes will only drift further apart, and the potential for violent unrest and civic dysfunction will only grow.” </p><p>The new media ecosystem has undoubtedly changed the way Americans see themselves and the world, and probably not for the better. But conspiracism has deep roots in this country, and the idea that a reality crisis started over the past year or even decade is simplistic. Social media has given a megaphone to perspectives — ranging from the necessary to the loathsome — that have long been ignored or suppressed by the architects of American reality. Just because we couldn’t hear them before doesn’t mean they weren’t always there. In these pages, Michelle Goldberg <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/01/opinion/facebook-social-media-problems.html">made a related case</a>: that social media has simply forced Americans to learn about one another, and we hate what we’ve found out. Call this, then, the too-much-reality crisis.</p>

            <p>Of all the conversations about the lives of trans people, the one that had legs this year was about trans athletes. In 2021, bills intended to stop trans people from competing in sports consistent with their identity were introduced in dozens of states. One could be forgiven for concluding that trans athletes were overwhelming women’s sports — that the wave of legislation had arisen in response to an urgent national crisis, particularly if you follow conservative news outlets.“Media Told to ‘Ignore’ Trans Athletes’ ‘Unfair Advantage,’ Other ‘Misinformation’” read one headline in The Daily Wire. </p><p>It’s true that trans women are competing in — and occasionally winning — athletic contests; <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2020-tokyo-olympics-sports-weightlifting-laurel-hubbard-e721827cdaf7299f47a9115a09c2a162">Laurel Hubbard</a>, a weightlifter from New Zealand, won two gold medals at the 2019 Pacific Games before competing in the Olympics this summer (where she did not make the podium). But victories by trans women are rare. “Higher levels of the male hormone testosterone are associated with better performance only in a very small number of athletic disciplines — 400 meters, 800 meters, hammer throw, pole vault,” one expert told NPR, and even in those sports, the hormones trans women take mean that their advantage lessens or disappears over time. </p><p>So is it possible that these laws are about something other than fairness in sports? In defending female athletes from the supposed threat of LeBron James in a wig, conservatives have found a means of enshrining the traditional gender binary into law.</p>

            <p>It used to mean something to be woke. From 1962 to 2008 — from when William Melvin Kelley used the word in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1962/05/20/archives/if-youre-woke-you-dig-it-no-mickey-mouse-can-be-expected-to-follow.html">a Times Opinion essay</a> to when Erykah Badu sang, “I stay woke,” on her song “Master Teacher” — to be woke meant to be aware, up-to-date, observant. In 2014, during the unrest in Ferguson, Mo., after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, #staywoke lit up the internet, urging people to open their eyes to police abuses. Being woke meant being conscious of the white supremacy embedded in everyday life. Since then, the term has been twisted and caricatured by conservatives, and it is now almost universally derided, even by liberals and leftists. Where it once might have been used to praise, it is now used to slander. Before 2021, it meant something to be woke. But by the end of it, it meant nothing at all.</p>

            <p>Britney Spears once said in an interview that she first realized she was a sex symbol when a photographer “totally tricked” her into posing in her underwear with the dolls in her childhood bedroom. The writer and actress Tavi Gevinson quoted the exchange in February, arguing that it’s possible, sometimes, to see experiences as sexually “empowering” in the moment and discover later that they were “exploitative.”</p><p>Ms. Spears ascended the heights of pop stardom in a different America — one in which a middle-aged Kevin Spacey could moon over a teenage girl in “American Beauty” and a 20-year-old Monica Lewinsky could become a late-night punching bag for going along with what now might be seen as sexual harassment by the president. That is to say, Ms. Spears spent her youth performing a puritanical fantasy of turn-of-the-century male desire: the slutty schoolgirl who’s also a virgin, the girl-next-door who sings, “I’m not that innocent.”</p><p>Her 2007 “breakdown” was in some sense a rebellion against the way her image was being consumed: When she shaved her head in front of paparazzi, she was publicly destroying the object they wanted to photograph. </p><p>At the time, Ms. Spears was simply seen as unhinged. Soon after, a judge shunted her into a restrictive conservatorship in which her image continued to be sold, now at the behest of male managers, including her father. For those in the Free Britney movement, she was a fairy-tale princess trapped behind castle walls, unable to drive by herself, taste Champagne, have a baby or freely use the money she was earning at a prodigious rate. This year, after a legal battle, she was released from the conservatorship in a much-celebrated happy ending — and a reminder of how profoundly our ideas about women’s bodies have changed.</p><p>One person paying close attention to Ms. Spears’s predicament was a teenage Emily Ratajkowski, as she recalls in her new essay collection, “My Body.” Ms. Ratajkowski is a supermodel who made her topless debut in the music video for Robin Thicke’s 2013 song “Blurred Lines,” and she remembers being surprised to be labeled anti-feminist: “Who was anyone to tell me that I wasn’t empowered by dancing around naked?” But her thinking has evolved with the times, and she now feels that modeling “hasn’t resulted in true empowerment.”  She adds, “That’s something I’ve gained only now, having written these essays.”</p><p> Her book, in other words, is framed as the solution to the problem it poses: whether a sex symbol can define her own image after having used it as her ticket to fame. “I’ve capitalized on my body within the confines of a cis-hetero, capitalist, patriarchal world,” she writes, “one in which beauty and sex appeal are valued solely through the satisfaction of the male gaze.”</p><p>Is “My Body” an attempt to reclaim a woman’s body from the male gaze or a bid to capitalize on a new cultural fantasy (once again embodied by Ms. Spears) of the empowered woman who takes back control? It might take another two decades to delineate the boundaries between the empowering and the exploitative. For now, they’re just blurred lines.</p>

            <p>The results are in, and the data has been tallied: Social media is harming girls. According to social scientists, it is linked to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2019/12/17/is-social-media-increasing-eating-disorders-in-teens/?sh=47587f23f246">eating disorders</a>, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/09/27/a-majority-of-teens-have-experienced-some-form-of-cyberbullying/">bullying</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/social-media-linked-rise-mental-health-disorders-teens-survey-finds-n982526">anxiety, depression</a> and even, mystifyingly, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/teen-girls-are-developing-tics-doctors-say-tiktok-could-be-a-factor-11634389201">Tourette’s-like tics</a>. During a pandemic that has severely limited teenagers’ real-life interactions, it’s hard to blame parents and doctors for worrying, but justified alarm has a tendency to slip into alarmism. Each new study is met with outrage, as if Instagram and other social media platforms were the equivalent of Big Tobacco or Exxon, withholding findings on the dangers of smoking or greenhouse gas emissions. In September a Wall Street Journal exposé added to the pile-on when it <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">declared</a> in a headline, on the evidence of internal survey results leaked by a whistle-blower, “Facebook Knows Instagram Is Toxic for Teen Girls, Company Documents Show.” Mark Zuckerberg was mostly ignored when he <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/office-space/the-question-weve-stopped-asking-about-teen-agers-and-social-media">tried to point out</a> that in nearly all of the categories surveyed, more girls credited Instagram with a positive impact. </p><p>Undeterred, the tech-lash lashed on. For Jonathan Haidt, a co-author of “The Coddling of the American Mind,” it was yet another example of Facebook’s unchecked villainy: “Instead of waiting for certainty and letting Facebook off the hook again,” <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/facebooks-dangerous-experiment-teen-girls/620767/">he wrote</a> in The Atlantic, “we should hold it and other social media companies accountable.” That’s what Senator Richard Blumenthal was trying to do when, apparently concerned by the practice (common among teenage girls) of forming second, fake Instagram accounts, he <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/04/1043150167/sen-blumenthals-finsta-flub-renews-questions-about-congress-grasp-of-big-tech">grilled</a> a Facebook executive testifying before Congress about whether she would “commit to ending finsta.” </p><p>It feels almost glib, in this climate, to raise the possibility that Instagram’s algorithm may be doing nothing more sinister than reflecting teenage girls’ desires back to them. Can social media sell us something poisonous if we ourselves are the product?</p>

            <p>“Critical race theory” was arguably the most important phrase of the year, but how much can we say now, at the end of it, about what it really means? Originally, the phrase described a field of study dedicated to examining the law’s role in sustaining racial inequality. Now, thanks to activists and provocateurs on the right, many voters and pundits have been convinced that C.R.T. represents, in the words of the Manhattan Institute’s Christopher Rufo, “a hostile ideology that seeks to divide the country by race and undermine the core principle of democratic control.” </p><p>It goes without saying that the right’s push to banish C.R.T. from schools amounts to a censorship campaign ⁠— an effort to keep ideas deemed dangerous away from the supposedly naïve and impressionable. But, as New York magazine’s Eric Levitz argued last month, the right’s opportunism and willingness to prohibit wholly innocuous material it has placed under the C.R.T. umbrella shouldn’t discourage progressives from speaking out against some of the genuinely dodgy ideas being advanced right now in the name of racial progress, such as the notion that certain behavioral traits and habits are intrinsically white. “A decent number of progressive groups and well-intentioned school districts do seem to be hiring quack consultants to dispense laughable race malarkey and recipes for organizational self-sabotage,” he<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/11/critical-race-theory-crt-schools-liberals-equity-consultants.html"> </a><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/11/critical-race-theory-crt-schools-liberals-equity-consultants.html">wrote</a>. “And progressives shouldn’t hesitate to say so.”</p><p>Any mass social movement, like the current wave of activism for racial justice, is certain to include its share of outré, misguided and counterproductive thinkers and actors; our hallowed push for civil rights in the 1960s, which promoted its own <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/godinamerica-civil-rights/">bizarre theories</a> of whiteness and featured plenty of performative self-flagellation from affluent liberals, was no exception. It’s ultimately up to the media whether the fringes of such movements come to dominate public conversation. Far too often, the mainstream press’s coverage of activism and cultural shifts among the young has been characterized by<a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/there-is-no-campus-free-speech-crisis-a-close-look-at-the-evidence/"> </a><a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/there-is-no-campus-free-speech-crisis-a-close-look-at-the-evidence/">sensationalism</a><a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/11/5/20944138/oberlin-banh-mi-college-campus-diversity"> </a><a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/11/5/20944138/oberlin-banh-mi-college-campus-diversity">and</a><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/evergreen-state-college-another-side_b_598cd293e4b090964295e8fc"> </a><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/evergreen-state-college-another-side_b_598cd293e4b090964295e8fc">shoddy</a><a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/mar/31/viral-media-reports/media-base-claims-about-emory-counseling-after-tru/"> </a><a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/mar/31/viral-media-reports/media-base-claims-about-emory-counseling-after-tru/">reporting</a>. The quality of our long-awaited national conversation about race probably isn’t going to improve, but it wouldn’t hurt for journalists to do some reflection about how our media environment contributed to the moral panic now sweeping the country.</p>

            <p>This summer, Barack Obama, a Leo, planned a party at his $12 million Martha’s Vineyard mansion to celebrate his 60th birthday. Reported details of the event — its star-studded 475-person guest list (David Letterman! Oprah!) and Questlove-endorsed <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-05/obama-s-meatless-birthday-menu-to-feature-impossible-eat-just">menu</a> — irritated many who felt it was tone-deaf and risky to throw such a big bash during a pandemic, as the Delta variant was spreading. Eventually, the Obamas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/04/us/politics/obama-cancels-60th-birthday-party.html">reportedly downsized</a> the guest list to a less-than-intimate crowd of “family and close friends” that supposedly included A-listers like Beyoncé and Tom Hanks. They disinvited Larry David (he rejoiced); they disinvited Rahm Emanuel (he whined). The Times’s Maureen Dowd fittingly anointed the birthday boy “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/14/opinion/barack-obama-birthday.html">Barack Antoinette</a>.” Stephen Colbert, who was among the disinvited, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYz7OgTaIo8">called it</a> “the cool kids’ party.” Washington gossip-watchers and a class of people best described as “those on Twitter” piled on. Perhaps next summer Mr. Obama will let them eat cake too.</p>

            <p>For me, the question isn’t whether America is governable now; the question is whether America has ever been governable.</p><p>Inspired by the turmoil and conflict of the 1960s, the historian Richard Hofstadter approached this question more than 50 years ago in a volume on political violence, edited with Michael Wallace, appropriately titled “<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/American_Violence/vJkOAQAAMAAJ?hl=en">American Violence: A Documentary History</a>.” The book opens with <a href="https://thebaffler.com/ancestors/reflections-violence-united-states">an essay</a> by Mr. Hofstadter on the role civil violence has played in the history of the United States. He walks his readers through the varieties of violence in American history, from race riots and lynchings to assassinations, vigilantism and the quotidian violence of a society that is and always has been saturated with lethal weapons.</p><p>Mr. Hofstadter observes, among other things, that political violence in the United States is rarely “insurrectionary,” that our “federal structure has deflected violence from the symbols of national power” and that American violence has most often been initiated with a “conservative bias,” meaning that it “has been unleashed against abolitionists, Catholics, radicals, workers and labor organizers, Negroes, Orientals and other ethnic or racial or ideological minorities and has been used ostensibly to protect the American, the Southern, the white Protestant or simply the established middle-class way of life and morals.” A high proportion of our violence, he writes, “has thus come from top dogs or the middle dogs.”</p><p>Fifty-one years later, it turns out Mr. Hofstadter was wrong about the insurrectionary character of American violence. (Although, in fairness, it took a cult of personality and the complicity of a major political party to produce the conditions that led to an attack on one of the “symbols of national power” of the United States.) Even still, the events of Jan. 6 fit the mold of his essay as much as they might break it. The rioters belonged to what one could call the petite bourgeoisie of American society, the small-time capitalists who form the backbone of the modern Republican Party: the men and women whom Donald Trump once praised as his “beautiful boaters.”</p><p>The simultaneously conservative and insurrectionary violence of Jan. 6 was followed, in relatively short order, by the Republican Party’s resistance to measures that might end or at least mitigate the Covid-19 pandemic. Which is to say that in 2021, Americans watched as their government was besieged by rioters and then watched as that government struggled to return the country to normalcy. This past year, then, raises the same question as the 1960s did for Mr. Hofstadter: Can the United States, with its stark divisions and conflict, be governed?</p><p>I am inclined to take his answer as my own. “When one considers American history as a whole,” he concludes, “it is hard to think of any very long period in which it could be said that the country has been consistently well governed. And yet its political system is, on the whole, a resilient and well-seasoned one, and on the strength of its history one must assume that it can summon enough talent and good will to cope with its afflictions.”</p><p>“The nation,” he continues, “seems to slouch onward into its uncertain future like some huge inarticulate beast, too much attainted by wounds and ailments to be robust, but too strong and resourceful to succumb.”</p>

            <p>Could a humble tab of acid or a handful of shrooms treat everything from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder to addiction and end-of-life anxiety? Funnily enough, to figure out whether psychedelics can bring solace to many suffering Americans, we’ve got to do the very thing psychedelics help people do: get out of our own way. We’ve got to take down the legal barriers erected in the moral panic after the Timothy Leary 1960s, when potent compounds like LSD and psilocybin were classed as Schedule 1 substances — the realm of bad, bad drugs with no medical value. Last year, Oregon became the first state to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of hard drugs such as LSD and psilocybin, and attitudes toward psychedelics have softened across the country. Some 35 percent of voters now believe that they have medical uses, <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/556304-poll-65-percent-of-voters-say-psychedelic-substances-do-not">according to a June poll</a>. </p><p>Even a tough-on-drugs Republican like Representative Dan Crenshaw of Texas was moved enough by veterans’ testimony about the healing power of these drugs that he <a href="https://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/Psychedelic%20Mental%20Health%20Pilot%20(Crenshaw)210914101201599.pdf">filed a measure</a> to permit the Pentagon to fund research into psychedelic therapies for military P.T.S.D. Reflecting on an experience with ayahuasca, Jesse Gould, a former Army Ranger, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/health/veterans-psychedelics-ptsd-depression.html">told The Times</a> in November that “it defragged my brain in a way that allowed it to heal.” In October, Johns Hopkins <a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2021/10/20/first-nih-grant-for-psychedelics-in-50-years/">received</a> the first federal grant in a half-century to enable research into therapeutic uses of a psychedelic: a study on psilocybin treatment for smoking addiction.</p><p>But if you’re hoping to munch on some acid or shrooms to get well, make sure to take the right amount. While it might be in vogue in Silicon Valley, microdosing — taking psychedelics in tiny, regular doses — was shown by participants in an Imperial College London <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/216134/citizen-scientists-show-placebo-effect-explain/">study</a> in March to have improved their well-being, mindfulness and life satisfaction as much as a placebo.</p>

            <p>In June, some wondered whether Eric Adams, the mayoral front-runner at the time, was a tristate two-timer. Varying residences listed in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/nyregion/eric-adams-residence.html">public records</a>, nights <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/brooklyn/coronavirus-blog/2020/05/20/borough-president-turns-borough-hall-into-a-residence">spent</a> in his office in Brooklyn Borough Hall and an apartment in Fort Lee, N.J., raised suspicions. Hoping to dispel the rumors, Mr. Adams led reporters on an unusual <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/06/09/eric-adams-shows-off-nyc-home-after-suggestion-that-he-lives-in-nj/">tour</a> of the unit in a Bedford-Stuyvesant townhouse where he claimed to live. For the conspiratorially inclined, the stunt yielded more questions than answers: On the wall were boyish sneakers (<a href="https://twitter.com/ericjohnkrebs/status/1402655441277104132?s=20">similar shoes</a> were later spotted on his adult son Jordan Coleman’s feet); in the fridge, sausages and salmon (Mr. Adams is vegan, and the food was also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/nyregion/eric-adams-residence.html">apparently</a> Mr. Coleman’s). What to make of it all? If Rudy Giuliani was “America’s mayor” and Bill de Blasio, it seems, is no one’s mayor, then perhaps Mr. Adams will find himself courting a key constituency: the bridge-and-tunnel crowd.</p>

            <p>In “Contagion,” Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 movie about a pandemic that kills 26 million people, the final sequence is a flashback: As rainforest is razed near Macau, China, a bat flies from a tree into a slaughterhouse. It drops a piece of banana, a pig eats it off the floor, and the pig is then killed and transported to a high-end restaurant. There the new disease infects an American businesswoman played by Gwyneth Paltrow. (Even a wellness guru can be patient zero.) The montage is eerie, but it is certain — something our own pandemic origin story is not. </p><p>Last year, many scientists posited that SARS-CoV-2 had emerged from a spillover event at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, where wild animals of various kinds were sold. But soon another theory emerged: that the virus escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which holds a library of bat coronaviruses. The lab leak theory quickly became a favorite, anti-China sound bite for commentators on the American right, and it gained wider interest in January after a New York magazine cover story and high-ranking scientists spoke up to support investigations. Despite little transparency or cooperation from the Chinese government, a report then emerged that several researchers at the Wuhan lab contracted Covid-19-like symptoms in the fall of 2019, before the virus was detected elsewhere. </p><p>Whichever theory proves true, both carry Icarian lessons about the consequences of global human development. Experimenting with viruses is a high-wire act, but so is crowding wild animals through habitat destruction and trade. Even in the simpler cinematic narrative of “Contagion,” it’s not just chance that introduces bat to pig. It’s bulldozers, too.</p>

            <p>In January two Subway customers filed a class-action complaint against the sandwich megachain, alleging that its tuna — which is grayish and spreads perhaps a little too easily for comfort — has been misleadingly marketed. Rather than the “high quality” skipjack tuna Subway advertised, the suit claimed that the product was a franken-mash of “various concoctions.”<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/19/style/subway-tuna-sandwich-lawsuit.html"> </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/19/style/subway-tuna-sandwich-lawsuit.html">Investigations</a><a href="https://www.insideedition.com/do-subways-tuna-sandwiches-actually-contain-tuna-inside-edition-investigates-64885"> </a><a href="https://www.insideedition.com/do-subways-tuna-sandwiches-actually-contain-tuna-inside-edition-investigates-64885">ensued</a>. The company tried to restore its good name (and put an end to the “<a href="https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2021/01/29/somethings-fishy-about-subways-tuna-sandwich-lawsuit-claims/">something’s fishy</a>” jokes) with<a href="http://subwaytunafacts.com/"> </a><a href="http://subwaytunafacts.com/">SubwayTunaFacts.com</a>, and a judge soon dismissed the lawsuit. But that didn’t stop the plaintiffs from filing a new version in November, which Subway has called “reckless and improper.” The plaintiffs’ claim this time? That samples of Subway’s tuna contained DNA from chickens, pigs or cows. Yikes.</p>

            <p>In a year rife with supply-chain snafus, the most memorable came in late March, when a humongous boat called the Ever Given got stuck in the Suez Canal, where it sat … and sat … and sat … wreaking havoc and holding up<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/26/business/ship-suez-canal.html"> </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/26/business/ship-suez-canal.html">as much as $10 billion in cargo a day</a>.

            <p>For my entire adult life, the left has either been marginal or on the defensive, but sometime during the Donald Trump administration, that seemed to change. In March, 2019, a few months after Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was sworn into Congress, New York magazine ran a cover story <a href="https://nymag.com/press/2019/03/on-the-cover-when-did-everyone-become-a-socialist.html">asking</a>, “When Did Everyone Become a Socialist?” The headline was deliberately hyperbolic but still reflected a sense of left ascendency. Suddenly, progressive politics was full of practical energy and optimism. The left seemed, briefly, like the future.</p><p>That moment is over. For me, much of this year has been about grappling with the politics of backlash. The left has managed to pull the center of gravity in the Democratic Party in its direction, but the party itself is in trouble, losing a number of races it expected to win and facing a future in which it will need ever-larger popular vote majorities to overcome the Republicans’ structural advantages. “Whatever we’re doing,” <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/virginia-elections-democrats/">wrote</a> Joan Walsh in The Nation, “it’s not working.”</p><p>Over the past year, lots of liberals and leftists alike have come to believe that the language of the social justice left is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/latino-civil-rights-organization-drops-latinx-official-communication-rcna8203">needlessly alienating</a>. The broader left – including those who privilege class concerns over cultural ones – have had to let go of the illusion that there exists a mass of alienated potential voters waiting to be roused by a sufficiently radical message. As the editors of the socialist magazine Jacobin <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/11/common-sense-solidarity-working-class-voting-report">wrote</a>, after undertaking an extensive survey, “We find little evidence that low-propensity voters fail to vote because they don’t see sufficiently progressive views reflected in the political platforms of mainstream candidates.”</p><p>That means progressives have to go into elections with the electorate they have, one that is more conservative than they would like. One response to this has been the rise of <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/democrats-cult-popular-095808221.html">popularism</a>, the idea that Democrats should tailor their policies to the preferences of voters rather than activists. Winning elections, <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/win-elections?">writes</a> the popularist Matthew Yglesias, “pretty clearly involves dropping the fantasy that everything is about mobilization and turnout and acknowledging that to win in right-of-center states, you need to annoy progressives some with noteworthy moderate positions.”</p><p>Opponents of popularism have argued both that it will lead to craven, ineffectual <a href="https://theweek.com/politics/1003369/democrats-david-shor-cult-of-popular">poll chasing</a> and that it would mean betraying key Democratic constituencies. “Black people, our concerns and our agenda, are always the first ones to be thrown overboard, even when we’re rowing the damn boat,” <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/democrats-election-shor/">wrote Elie Mystal</a> in The Nation. Instead of accommodating themselves to the current system, the critics of popularism argue, Democrats need to drastically <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2021/10/25/arguing-about-popularism-is-a-dead-end-fix-american-democracy-instead/">reform it</a>.</p><p>The dilemma is that structural reform is at once urgent and nearly impossible. In a biting, despairing essay in The New Republic, Osita Nwanevu <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/162868/for-the-people-act-filibuster-democracy">argued</a> that all that’s left for the left is “a long project of ideological conversion” that might gradually encourage voters to demand “the establishment of a system that we might reasonably call American democracy.” A few years ago, I wondered how the left would try to lead. Now I wonder how it will cope with an era of thwarted hopes.</p>

            <p>George Floyd’s death is an anomaly among police killings in that it can legally be referred to as a murder, thanks to the unanimous conviction of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in April. Mr. Chauvin’s guilty verdict is rightly viewed as a victory, given how few police officers are convicted or even charged after using deadly force, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/">despite killing nearly a thousand people per year</a>, a disproportionate number of whom are Black. Among the activists who organized the racial justice protests last year — one of the largest protest movements in U.S. history — the initial feelings were relief and elation. </p><p>That summer, it felt as though radical ideas were seeping into the mainstream, but after the verdict, the energy of the movement began to dissipate. Policy-level discussions of abolishing police departments have largely stalled across the country. “‘Abolish’ mutated into ‘defund’; ‘defund’ melted into ‘delay,’” <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/george-floyd-afropessimism/">wrote</a> the Afro-pessimist Frank Wilderson in The Nation. Many activists now believe that Mr. Chauvin’s conviction ended up restoring faith in the status quo — at least until the next high-profile case, when the cycle will begin again. Of all the heartbreaks of Mr. Floyd’s story, the most perverse is this: Winning justice for him may have delayed justice for the rest of us.</p>

            <p>When GameStop stock jumped from $17 to $347 in the month of January, a new debate opened up in the world of finance: Do stock prices represent a market consensus, or do they represent the views of a random group of Reddit commenters? No year has tested the efficient-markets hypothesis — the idea that stocks trade at fair market value based on all available information — more than 2021: Elon Musk tweeting “Use Signal” (referring to a nonprofit encrypted messaging app) sent stock in a different, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/elon-musk-boosts-signal-app-signal-advance-stock-jumps-1100percent.html">obscure Texas company called Signal Advance</a> soaring; and the useless cryptocurrency Dogecoin, disavowed by its own creator, climbed in value 100-fold between January and May. The rise of the blockchain-based NFT economy — the main innovation of which appears to be the mass production of “scarce,” tacky objects — seems to be only further evidence that asset prices don’t reflect anything but sentiment. </p><p>GameStop has corrected a bit from its baffling highs, but value investors who focus on business fundamentals and grumble at meme investors should consider that the Federal Reserve appears to be as sensitive to consumer fears of inflation as it is to the real thing. If <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/nov/18/viral-image/photos-high-gas-prices-are-california-station-s-no/">a misleading photo of $7 gas prices</a> can go viral, it’s clear that what matters is how people feel about the economy, not the facts. Is the economy made of memes? Always has been.</p>

            <p>Early this year, we were repeatedly told that “everyone” was abandoning big cities — settling down in the suburbs, purpling rural districts, turning Bozeman, Mont., into “Boz Angeles.” While “everyone” rarely means <em>everyone </em>— and in this case it mostly meant white-collar remote workers — pundits at least agreed that major metropolises weren’t exactly growing.</p><p>According to Henry Grabar in Slate, “The model behind the urban renaissance of the last 30 years — immigrants and yuppies — is dead.” This narrative has persisted, but most of the elegies turned out to be premature: According to an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/urban-exodus-people-leaving-cities-charts-exurbs-real-estate-moving-2021-8">August report</a> from UBS, the recently departed were flocking back. In the third quarter of the year, apartment sales in Manhattan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/05/realestate/new-york-real-estate-sales.html">hit a three-decade peak</a>. Home prices in many urban areas have crept back up to pre-pandemic heights (and higher), and housing stock has dropped in both rural and suburban areas, meaning that living space is scarcer and less affordable everywhere. Geographic horizons may be opening up for the wealthy, but they continue to close in on everyone else.</p>

            <p>As Gen Z’s advance guard enters the work force, such as it is, their denim preferences, Slack etiquette and penchant for self-care are inspiring angst among older colleagues. Even the Zoomers’ immediate forebears — the millennials once at the white-hot center of youth culture — describe feeling fear and foreboding at the prospect of committing an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/business/gen-z-workplace-culture.html">emoji faux pas</a>, fielding a request for a mental health day or staking out a companywide activist position. Some of these concerns reflect predictable anxieties about losing touch with the latest fashions; ominous “kids these days” tales have most likely circulated since our foraging ancestors were scandalized by Generation Agriculture. But others betray a sense of unease among managers who are dealing with a resurgence of worker power and a labor movement revival. The spotlight on generational trends may be obscuring a broader change in employee expectations for more humane hours, safer conditions and fairer treatment. A revolt, it would seem, is underway against a broken and oppressive corporate culture, but it’s coming from workers of all ages.</p>

            <p>Naomi Osaka, the brightest young light in tennis, withdrew from the French Open in May, <a href="https://twitter.com/naomiosaka/status/1399422304854188037">revealing</a> that she had suffered long bouts of depression since winning the U.S. Open in 2018. She resurfaced to light the cauldron at the Tokyo Olympics, played a few more weeks and then took another hiatus, this one ongoing and indefinite. “I feel like for me recently, when I win, I don’t feel happy,” <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/naomi-osaka-thinking-about-taking-break-tennis-while-after-u-n1278507">she said</a>. “I feel more like a relief. And then when I lose, I feel very sad. I don’t think that’s normal.” Elsewhere at the Olympics, Simone Biles suddenly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/07/27/sports/olympics/biles-vault-gymnastics.html">bailed</a> on her vault during the team final, saying that she had the “twisties,” a loss of awareness that gymnasts sometimes feel while maneuvering in midair. Citing her mental health and naming Osaka as an inspiration, she withdrew from several more finals.</p><p>To patriots of a certain persuasion, this marked the beginning of the end — the self-care generation’s attack on merit, resilience and winning itself. (Texas Deputy Attorney General Aaron Reitz <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/texas-deputy-attorney-general-calls-biles-selfish-childish-national-embarrassment-for-dropping-all-around">called</a> Biles a “national embarrassment.”) To a well-adjusted person who can’t find a way to get that angry about an athlete taking a break, it was the beginning of something refreshing: A fuller definition of “health,” taking stock of both body and mind, had finally come to sports, the most physical arena in public life. This was the year we learned, rather belatedly, that the people performing transcendent feats of strength, agility and timing — returning a 110-mile-per-hour serve or completing two and a half twists in the air — must also feel mentally up to the task.</p>

            <p>Sally Rooney, the Marxist queen of millennial literature, published her third book this September. Before its release, her publisher sent out a promotional package that included a bucket hat — a scrupulously ugly daffodil-yellow flop of a thing — with the book’s title, “Beautiful World, Where Are You,” stitched into its front. The hat soon became the summer’s literary status symbol. (Lena Dunham got one.) Certain pedants accused Ms. Rooney of betraying her Marxist beliefs because, after all, she once <a href="https://www.pw.org/content/sally_rooney">said she was</a> “very skeptical of the way in which books are marketed as commodities,” but that didn’t stop her publisher’s publicity campaign. The hat itself never went on sale. Eventually, one might crop up on eBay, but until then, we normal people, I suppose, will just have to read the book.</p>

            <p>There wasn’t really anyone to root for when Richard Branson raced Jeff Bezos off the planet in July. Together with Elon Musk, the men who spent much of the year locked in what some have called the billionaire space race are worth nearly <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/14/tech/jeff-bezos-richard-branson-elon-musk-space-race-scn/index.html">half a trillion dollars</a>. Those still inclined to believe good money comes from good sense should mull over the logistics of Mr. Bezos’ proposal that we solve our environmental problems by simply moving “all heavy industry and all polluting industry” into the heavens. </p><p>Like the other cosmic promises we’ve heard from this set, Mr. Bezos’ assertion is best understood as part of a public relations campaign: a decade after Occupy Wall Street, with a re-energized left inveighing against the rich ever more loudly, billionaires are itching to demonstrate their value to the American people. If we’re getting GM plants on asteroids, a Mars where you can raise your kids or at least some men on the moon again⁠, Americans may be more inclined to accept an economy that allows a man like Mr. Bezos to passively make<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/jeff-bezos-make-per-minute-net-worth-b1887310.html"> over $100,000 a minute</a>. </p><p>Some in the conservative press were willing to give that argument an assist. National Review’s editor, Rich Lowry, <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/07/the-beauty-of-billionaires-in-space/">wrote</a> that this year’s spaceflights were examples of “stunning human achievement” foolishly impugned by critics with “contempt for human endeavor.” In contrast, Luke Savage of Jacobin <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/07/jeff-bezos-space-flight-inequality">called</a> them “not a stunning human achievement but rather a uniquely American disgrace.” </p><p>In general, the American people don’t seem quite as animated as commentators and politicians are about billionaires and their antics. In March a Vox/Data for Progress <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2021/3/dfp-recode-voters-attitudes-billionaires.pdf">survey</a> found that 54 percent of likely voters ⁠— including 51 percent of Democrats ⁠— view the existence of billionaires as neither a good nor a bad thing for the country. Sixty-eight percent of likely voters ⁠— and 55 percent of Democrats ⁠— similarly disagree with the idea that the wealth of billionaires is immoral. These numbers are well in keeping with polling that has long suggested that voters <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/many-americans-think-economic-inequality-is-a-problem-just-not-the-most-pressing-one/">rarely prioritize</a> inequality as a policy issue. So while there’s ample reason to be troubled by our new masters of the universe, we should fret a bit, too, about ordinary Americans’ seeming ambivalence to inequality.</p>

            <p>Film editors, graduate students, Froot Loops cereal makers, nurses, coal miners. In 2021, tens of thousands of unionized workers in the United States went on strike or got very close to doing so. The labor historian Gabriel Winant <a href="https://newleftreview.org/sidecar/posts/strike-wave">described this activity as “the sharp, organized tip”</a> of the Great Resignation: the nearly 4.3 million Americans who left their jobs in August alone. But Marianne Garneau, an organizer, <a href="https://brooklynrail.org/2021/12/field-notes/Striketober-Hopes-and-Realities">warned not to mistake</a> employment leverage for lasting power: “Labor markets don’t create actions,” she wrote. “Only organizing does.” Even a surge in strikes has limited impact when less than 11 percent of American employees belong to unions. </p><p>But there are hopeful signs. The members of two international unions — the Teamsters and the United Auto Workers — recently approved changes that could lead to mass organizing campaigns. And a growing number of nonunion workers, from truck drivers to Amazon warehouse workers and freelance food deliveristas, are experimenting with strategies outside the collective bargaining agreement. It’s that mix that characterizes this post-Occupy Wall Street moment in labor: a desire to organize but in more creative, innovative ways.</p>

            <p>Bankers can’t even agree on a method for valuing Bitcoin, the most famous cryptocurrency, let alone on whether it’s a smart investment. In a <a href="https://www.seba.swiss/research/A-new-fair-value-model-for-Bitcoin">report</a> last year, SEBA Bank of Switzerland said, “According to the existing valuation models, the value of the Bitcoin network is between zero and 100 trillion US dollars.” That range, it noted helpfully, “is so vast that it does not provide any insight.” Taking its own shot, the bank pegged the fair value of a single Bitcoin around $10,000, which it revised up this September to somewhere between $50,000 and $75,000.

            <p>If the outlook for habitability on our little planet grew more hopeful in 2021, a cynic might argue it was only because we were already at the limit of collective hopelessness. During the Trump years — as the United States tore up international climate deals and flood and fire consumed swaths of the globe — unrestrained alarm about the climate became the most cleareyed of takes. Things had to get better under a Biden administration, because how could they get any worse? </p><p>That view is ungenerous. In politics, business and technology, the year brimmed with genuine reasons for optimism on the climate. Congress <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/06/climate/infrastructure-bill-climate.html">passed an infrastructure bill</a> with billions of dollars in funding to bolster the nation against climate disaster (though West Virginia’s Sen. Joe Manchin appears to be blocking passage of a larger bill that would commit an additional <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/climate/climate-change-framework-bill.html?searchResultPosition=5">half a trillion dollars</a>).

            <p>This was the year in which we shelved discussions of white-collar work’s free-roaming, revolutionary future and instead settled into the awkward “long now” of the pandemic office. When <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/columns/ryan-ori/ct-biz-covid-19-return-to-office-challenges-2021-ryan-ori-20210104-gcb5ls3lsra7fefznx7bw2oh7a-story.html">vaccines</a> were authorized in the United States last winter, they seemed to promise to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccines-arent-yet-luring-workers-back-to-the-office-11613314801">hasten the return</a> to traditional, in-person jobs. Many people became guinea pigs for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-you-thought-working-from-home-was-messy-here-comes-hybrid-work-11621935000">hybrid work</a>, and despite the neologism, it turned out to be <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/30/hybrid-office-remote-work-citigroup-ford-target/">pretty structured</a> after all. Dispatches from today’s workplaces paint a strange picture: you might <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/16/business/return-to-office-hybrid-work.html">Zoom from inside the office</a> or need to refresh<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dont-be-that-awkward-colleague-a-guide-to-office-etiquette-11636347660"> basic etiquette</a>. </p><p>Employees looking for a drastic change soon realized they would have to make it themselves. Millions of fed-up workers quit this year — many of them to chase “postpandemic adventure,” in what the Times technology columnist Kevin Roose memorably dubbed the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/technology/welcome-to-the-yolo-economy.html">YOLO economy</a>. In retrospect, it was mostly C-suite managers who were able to shape the way we did white-collar work; ordinary employees rarely had a say in the new platforms they had to learn, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/11/business/rto-lyft-google-cnn.html">dates</a> of their return to office or even the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/done-working-from-home-prepare-for-more-hot-desks-11623628801">desks</a> they used. So it’s unsurprising that workers started to care less about futuristic ways to have the same old meetings and focus more on getting the hell out.</p>

            <p>In the cinematic universe of the new “Dune” movie, it is the year 10191. The threat of intergalactic war looms, and the protagonist must travel to the most dangerous planet in the galaxy to fulfill his destiny and ensure the future of his people. He alone can save the world and become the next emperor of the universe. That man’s name? Paul. </p><p>When the film came out, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=dune%20name%20paul&src=typed_query&f=top">viewers</a> were quick to point out the unexpectedly lackluster — and seemingly anachronistic — name of its hero, causing many to wonder: Will names like Paul still be around in another generation, let alone thousands of years in the future? According to the Social Security Administration, maybe not. Its records show that the popularity of the name has been in <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/babyname.cgi">more or less steady decline for the past century</a>. It was No. 252 on the agency’s 2020 list of most popular names for baby boys, down from 100 in 2000 and 16 in 1965, the year the original “Dune” novel was published. The <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/popularity_increase.html">10 fastest-rising</a> boys’ names? Zyair, Jaxtyn, Jakobe, Kylo, Aziel, Ander, Dior, Truett and Karsyn. For those of us still acclimating to Apple and Blue Ivy, these may take some getting used to. But, hey, at least it’s not <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/25/elon-musk-grimes-change-baby-name-roman-numerals-look-better">X Æ A-Xii</a>.</p>

            <p>Living in China this year has felt like standing on shifting ground. Since the tech mogul Jack Ma<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1fe0559f-de6d-490e-b312-abba0181da1f"> fell from</a> the Chinese Communist Party’s good graces last year — his company’s I.P.O. suspended and his influence curtailed — the country has been transformed. In the following months, the party unleashed a set of regulations so broad in scope that it has been called a “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-crackdown-tech-celebrities-xi/2021/09/09/b4c2409c-0c66-11ec-a7c8-61bb7b3bf628_story.html">crackdown on everything</a>”: no after-school tutoring, no cryptocurrency, no real estate speculation, no superfandom, no effeminate men, no online video games for minors on weekdays. To anyone who still believed that the arc of China’s future bent toward liberalization, that economic reform would yield political opening, the past several months have made clear that the country has swerved off those teleological tracks.</p><p>Deng Xiaoping’s “exuberant reforms did start to bend China’s Leninist metal,” Orville Schell <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2021-06-22/life-party">wrote</a> in Foreign Affairs, but now, under President Xi Jinping, “China has begun to snap back into its old Maoist shape.” The old laissez-faire “<a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2002/01/17/to-get-rich-is-glorious">to get rich is glorious</a>” ethos of the Dengist era is out; highly controlled, top-down “equitable development” is back in. Faced with an onslaught of crises — deepening inequality, an aging population, ecological degradation and the coronavirus pandemic — Mr. Xi has decided to tighten the reins. No one is certain where the road will lead, other than that the party will be deciding China’s future.</p>

            <p>Normally, losing presidential candidates don’t exert much of a continued hold on their political parties. But Donald Trump is different: His bogus but potent claim to be the legitimate winner in 2020, piled atop his unique celebrity-populist appeal, has made him a kind of king in exile for the Republican Party, awaiting restoration in 2024.</p><p>Whether this strange situation can last till 2024 is the subject of a lot of tea-leaf reading. Occasionally a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/10/06/two-thirds-of-republicans-want-trump-to-retain-major-political-role-44-want-him-to-run-again-in-2024/">poll will come along</a> that seems to show limits to the Republican enthusiasm for another Trump campaign, and in the day-to-day he clearly lacks absolute power over his party: Republicans in Congress feel reasonably comfortable ignoring him on certain votes, Mitch McConnell continues to bestride the Senate in the face of Mr. Trump’s avowed hatred, and the former president’s primary endorsees are not all guaranteed victory.</p><p>But these concrete limits on Mr. Trump’s influence, often cited this year by observers hoping that his power will slowly ebb, haven’t yet created a situation in which some other powerful Republican can challenge him directly and expect to succeed. If, for instance, Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia survives the primary challenge that Mr. Trump has helped instigate against him, it will probably be by avoiding confrontation rather than going the route of Representative Liz Cheney and fighting the former president head-on.</p><p>The same point applies to any imaginable Republican challenge to Mr. Trump in 2024, should he run (and we should expect him to run). There might be a path to stealing the party away from its current leader, but it will have to be the smoothest, gentlest of thefts.</p>

            <p>For some time, the great male American novelist has been under siege. It’s been more than 20 years since John Updike was called a “penis with a thesaurus,” since Kate Millett <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/09/kate-millett-obituary-sexual-politics-appreciation.html">accused</a> Norman Mailer of being a “prisoner of the virility cult,” since Vivian Gornick <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/02/vivian-gornick-takes-on-novelists-bellow-roth/">asked</a>, “Why do these men hate women?” In the spring the literary world braced itself for yet another round of debate about Philip Roth’s sexism — and whether it disqualified his work — when W.W. Norton published an authorized biography of the novelist by Blake Bailey. Some followed Cynthia Ozick in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/books/review/philip-roth-the-biography-blake-bailey.html">deeming the book</a> “a narrative masterwork,” but others were less charitable. Far from interrogating Mr. Roth’s treatment of women, Mr. Bailey acts like “an adoring wingman who thinks his friend can do better,” <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/161640/philip-roths-revenge-fantasy-review-blake-bailey">wrote Laura Marsh</a> of The New Republic. (In a particularly egregious passage, Mr. Bailey critiques the postchildbirth appearance of Mr. Roth’s first wife’s vagina.)</p><p>The controversy curdled into self-parody after allegations came to light that Mr. Bailey had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/books/norton-philip-roth-biography-blake-bailey.html">sexually assault</a>ed two women, one of whom had been his student. The publishing executive Valentina Rice said that she had anonymously reported to Norton executives that in 2015 Mr. Bailey <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/books/philip-roth-blake-bailey.html">raped her</a> but it appears that Norton did not thoroughly investigate the matter. On the heels of the public outcry, however, the house took the book out of print and paused its publicity campaign, in what Mr. Bailey’s lawyer called a “drastic” response to “false and unsubstantiated” allegations. The National Coalition Against Censorship agreed. “The ongoing cultural reckoning of what to do with the art of morally compromised artists is a complicated one,” <a href="https://ncac.org/news/book-blake-bailey-allegations-norton">read</a> its public statement. “Erasure and silencing can gratify the desire to punish, but it does so at the cost of constraining the circulation of ideas.” </p><p>At the height of the #MeToo movement, Claire Dederer published a viral <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/11/20/art-monstrous-men/">essay</a> with the headline “What Do We Do With the Art of Monstrous Men?” Four years later, the answer appears to be: disavow it, but only when it threatens a company’s public image. Mr. Roth’s works, of course, remain widely available, but the scandal may have defeated his aim in authorizing a biography to begin with. He had first sought out a biographer, he <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/03/29/the-secrets-philip-roth-didnt-keep">reportedly said</a> before his death in 2018, in order to help counter what he saw as the gravest threat to his posthumous reputation: “This whole mad fucking misogynistic bullshit!”</p>

This year, the University of California <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-11-18/uc-slams-door-on-sat-and-all-standardized-admissions-tests">announced</a> that it would no longer use standardized test scores for admissions decisions, ​and commentators predicted that the move would lead to the demise of admissions testing throughout the country. (Just last week, Harvard  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/16/us/harvard-admissions-act-sat.html">extended</a> its pandemic-era test optional admissions policy for the next four years.)</p><p>The National Education Association has <a href="https://www.nea.org/advocating-for-change/new-from-nea/racist-beginnings-standardized-testing">described</a> standardized tests as “instruments of racism and a biased system,” drawing on the antiracist scholarship of Ibram X. Kendi, who has long argued that the SAT is a vestige of eugenics. The SAT is biased because it is correlated with parental income, but so is the rest of the application packet: Grade point average, recommendations and personal statements have all been shown to track with class.</p><p>Dropping the SAT in the absence of any larger economic reform is a trivial victory and a potential distraction. As long as economic inequality remains — as long as poor children, who are disproportionately Black, languish in failing schools — any accurate diagnostic of our students’ abilities will reveal the effects of that inequality. Removing the diagnosis doesn’t treat the disease.</p>

            <p>On Jan. 2, the country was post-hangover, punchy and bored from a seemingly endless quarantined life. That was also the day a foolish man tweeted a very long thread about his 9-year-old daughter trying to open a can of baked beans. </p><p>In that soon infamous (and soon deleted) story, the father did not help his daughter as she struggled with the can opener, and he portrayed the situation as a “<a href="https://twitter.com/ManiacalV/status/1345870405085573122/photo/1">teaching moment</a>” of self-reliance for the girl, who ultimately did get at the beans. “Bean Dad” became a trending topic, then national news. Commenters accused Bean Dad of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55549536">abusive and toxic</a> behavior. He quickly <a href="http://www.johnroderick.com/an-apology">apologized</a> and said that “a dozen” people had reported him to child protective services and that his family had received a visit from the agency. </p><p>The fracas encapsulated everything that is wrong with both social media and parenting discourse. Encouraging your tween to figure out how to use a can opener by herself is not child abuse, but parents are frequently told that any number of our mundane decisions have perilously high stakes. (If you don’t believe me, check out any forum about sleep training or breast-feeding.) I wish I could say we all learned a lesson from Bean Dad’s momentary virality. Indeed, I thought Bean Dad himself had learned something, because he, for a while,<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/bean-dad-deletes-twitter-account-anti-semitic-homophobic-tweets-resurface/"> </a><a href="https://www.thewrap.com/bean-dad-deletes-twitter-account-anti-semitic-homophobic-tweets-resurface/">deactivated his Twitter account</a>. But he’s<a href="https://twitter.com/johnroderick"> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/johnroderick">back on the platform</a>, stuck in the same broken system with the rest of us, having arguments that aren’t worth a hill of beans.</p>

            <p>This year was a violent one. At least nine major U.S. cities set homicide records, and the rise in violence has prompted many governors and mayors to call for increasing the number of police officers on the streets. There is a strong consensus among social scientists that hiring more police officers reduces crime. In a paper widely cited by law enforcement advocates and criminal justice reformers alike, the economist Aaron Chalfin and his co-authors assessed the effects of the police on serious crime in over 200 cities. They found that on average, a life is saved for every 10 to 17 officers hired.</p><p>But the more detailed the data, the more complicated the picture becomes, particularly for marginalized communities. On average, enlarging the police force is doubly effective for reducing Black homicide rates, but the trend disappears in places with high concentrations of Black people, including most Southern cities. Expanding policing also comes with real costs: Having more officers means more Black men arrested for low-level offenses such as disorderly conduct and loitering. Crime is undoubtedly oppressive for communities, but is harassment and mass incarceration any less so? As DMX wrote in the song “Who We Be,” “The options: get shot, go to jail or getcha ass kicked.” America’s current approach to rising crime simply forces marginalized communities to decide which forms of oppression are tolerable. We’ve got “options.”</p>

            <p>When it emerged last year that Donald Trump had been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, The Atlantic published an age-old demand: “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/09/end-nobel-peace-prize/616300/">End the Nobel Peace Prize</a>.” The controversial designation, which has recognized efforts toward “peace” by the likes of Henry Kissinger, has long been verging on farce, and the selection committee did itself no favors with its choices in recent years. In 2019 the selection of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed of Ethiopia, who presided over atrocities against the Tigray ethnic minority, led journalists to publish <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/world/africa/ethiopia-abiy-ahmed-nobel-war.html">stories</a> on his awful human rights record. Perhaps in response, the 2020 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/09/world/2020-nobel-peace-prize.html">award</a> went to the World Food Program, a totally bland choice.</p><p>But in October, something completely unexpected happened. The committee made pretty great picks: Maria Ressa, a Filipin, and Dmitri A. Muratov, a Russian, who are outstanding journalists and heavily persecuted members of a profession that is imperiled around the globe. Their selection showed a timely recognition of the dangers of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/10/08/world/nobel-prize">“fake news”</a> rhetoric and a welcome expansion of “peace”-promoting actors beyond bureaucratic bodies or untested leaders. The Washington Post’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/08/nobel-peace-prize-journalists-maria-ressa-dmitry-muratov-won-right-time/">editorial board</a> summarized public opinion when it proclaimed that Ms. Ressa and Mr. Muratov had “won the Nobel Peace Prize at just the right time.” At least briefly, the Nobel Peace Prize has managed to snatch gravitas from the jaws of irrelevance.</p>

            <p>Coined by the entrepreneur and Nasty Gal founder Sophia Amoruso in 2014, the term “girlboss” was always sort of terrible. Simultaneously infantilizing and exclusionary, it signaled a distinctly white, affluent and cutesy kind of feminism. At least for a time, the term offered a model for female success that was sorely lacking a space in the culture, but quite quickly it went from an earnest ideal to a shorthand for toxic female power. This year, with the emergence of an updated phrase, “<a href="https://www.vox.com/22466574/gaslight-gatekeep-girlboss-meaning">gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss</a>,” it seemed to be employed mostly to lampoon the very type of brazenly ambitious women who popularized it in the first place. </p><p>The change in usage took place in tandem with the demise of the girlbosses themselves, as many of the women who once proudly claimed the title have proved to be just as bad as the male C.E.O.s they aimed to replace. An abridged list includes Steph Korey, a co-founder of the luggage company Away; Christene Barberich, a co-founder and former editor in chief of Refinery29; Leandra Medine Cohen, the founder of the fashion blog Man Repeller; Audrey Gelman, a co-founder and former C.E.O. of the Wing; and Yael Aflalo, the former C.E.O. and the founder of the clothing brand Reformation. And, of course, Elizabeth Holmes, whose spectacular downfall may just prove to be the final nail in the coffin of girlbossdom.</p>

            <p>Havana syndrome, the Lyme disease of the geopolitical class, surpassed 200 cases this year. Strange symptoms — including migraines, hearing loss and vertigo — started afflicting American diplomats in Cuba in 2016, after embassy workers reported hearing loud buzzing noises. Marco Rubio was among the politicians quick to suggest that the diplomats had been targeted by an experimental microwave weapon. Others assumed mass psychogenic illness. This year BuzzFeed News obtained a declassified report completed by the State Department in 2018, which concluded that some of the victims may have reacted to, of all things, the chirp of the Indies short-tailed cricket. That officials have suffered from something, whether malicious or not, is certain, but some hawks in the intelligence community are not waiting for answers. In October the journalist Julia Ioffe, <a href="https://puck.news/havana-syndrome-in-bidens-washington/">writing</a> for a venture-capital-backed news site called Puck, interviewed officials in Washington who believe the symptoms to be the result of Russian attacks, in an article some viewed as irresponsibly credulous. She quoted an anonymous official hungry to retaliate: “We got Bin Laden with medium confidence.”</p>

            <p>In August, as Americans prepared to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Sept. 11, they awoke to images of a war they had forgotten — the U.S. military leaving Afghanistan in disarray, the Taliban returning to Kabul triumphant. President Biden soon declared the end of the forever wars, and many in the media postulated the start of a new political era, but in truth they have become so vast and insidious that they may be impossible to end. </p><p>From 2018 to 2020, the United States conducted some form of counterterrorism activity in 85 countries, using drone strikes, military exercises and dubious legal frameworks. Authoritarians from Xi Jinping to Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Narendra Modi have learned from the targeting of Muslim and Arab Americans after Sept. 11, employing broadly defined antiterrorism laws to persecute their own citizens. In his book “Reign of Terror,” published in August, the journalist Spencer Ackerman argues that the ongoing wars of the past 20 years — with their xenophobia, anti-Muslim sentiment and violence — helped lead to the rise of Donald Trump. Mr. Ackerman and others have observed that homeland security laws intended to respond to foreign terrorist threats are now used against citizens protesting police violence at home. </p><p>The war on terrorism has shattered entire nations and economies, created <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2021/Costs%20of%20War_Vine%20et%20al_Displacement%20Update%20August%202021.pdf">at least 38 million refugees</a> and <a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2021-09-01/costsofwar">killed some 900,000 people</a>, but the dumb privilege of being a global superpower means that many Americans remain unaware of or unconcerned by how their country shapes the lives of others. No new political era can begin until that changes. </p><p>Americans would need to start caring that, across the world, the war is far from over for the maimed, the grieving, the impoverished, the stateless. “While the U.S. military can and must end its foreign wars,” the historian Ussama Makdisi <a href="https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/forever-wars-forgotten-wars-and-the-bloody-cycle-of-us-exceptionalism-49598">writes</a>, “native peoples and countries cannot simply ‘end’ the war; they will live in and among its consequences for generations.”</p>

            <p>Tabloid coverage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana’s separation and divorce may have tarnished the monarchy’s reputation, but the damage wrought by the current royal family feud comes on the brink of a drastic change that will likely determine its fate. The crown’s survival after Queen Elizabeth’s death depends on her subjects accepting Charles — someone who has long been polarizing, even unpopular — as king. </p><p>During a blockbuster interview with Oprah Winfrey in March, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, said she was kept silent while a working member of the royal family. If so, she and her husband, Prince Harry, are now determined to finally tell their side of the story. Are Meghan and Harry long-suffering victims defending themselves from a racist and unfeeling institution? Or are they greedy hypocrites who still trade on their titles despite eschewing royal duties? The answer tends to vary based on which side of the Atlantic you call home. </p><p>So far, the British press has largely taken the royal family’s side in this dispute, but Meghan and Harry’s allegations of racism and indifference have had more purchase in countries like Jamaica and Australia, which have been considering republicanism but may be waiting to move until the death of the queen. When it comes to this media war, Harry and Meghan could lose family relationships, but the House of Windsor could lose the Commonwealth — and even the crown.</p>

            <p>The media has to stop using the word “riot” to describe the events of Jan. 6. What happened at the Capitol was not spontaneous tumult; it was the violent peak of a protracted coup attempt that began when President Donald J. Trump lost re-election. Earlier phases of this unprecedented campaign to overthrow American democracy included Mr. Trump’s lies about the results of the vote, his intimidation of state election officials and a bus tour that riled up his base. But its roots run deeper still, through decades of far-right, white-supremacist organizing intended to break the arc of justice in favor of a regressive vision of America.</p><p>Loath to acknowledge the Republican Party’s slide toward nativism and violence, many conservative pundits have dismissed alarm about Jan. 6 as hysteria. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Barton Swaim scorned “the left’s irrational fear of conquest by the right.” At National Review, Michael Brendan Dougherty acknowledged that Jan. 6 was a disgrace “caused by Donald Trump’s dishonesty,” but he insisted it was not a coup attempt, explaining “the Trumpers at the Capitol couldn’t have held on to a public library or a Chick-fil-A if they had tried.” In an appearance on “The View” this fall, Condoleezza Rice encouraged Americans to “move on.” Much of the country seems ready to. Polling in October found that more than one-third of Americans do not believe that Jan. 6 was an attack on the government and that more than half said enough is already known about what led to the storming of the Capitol.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump and his allies are closing ranks and preparing for their next assault on democracy. “The Republicans who vocally denounced Trump’s attempted coup are facing purges,” Jonathan Chait wrote in New York magazine, “while those who supported the coup are getting bolder.” The historian Timothy Snyder perhaps put it best in an interview on CNN, saying, “If we’re not prepared for the attempt for people to take power undemocratically in 2024, then we’re just at this point pathetically naïve.”</p>

            <p>In November, Ted Cruz and other well-adjusted people denounced “Sesame Street” for peddling “government propaganda” by having Big Bird get vaccinated, while the chairman of the American Conservative Union, Matt Schlapp, called PBS <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/new-asian-american-muppet-prompts-cpac-president-call-defunding-pbs-rcna6076">“insane”</a> after “Sesame Street” announced the debut of Ji-Young, the show’s first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/15/arts/television/new-sesame-street-character-ji-young.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSesame%20Street%E2%80%9D%20is%20welcoming%20its,rice%20cakes%2C%20on%20the%20show.">Asian American muppet.</a> These two developments were, to the mind of some conservatives, indisputable proof that the woke mob had seized this most important block in the intellectual street war for America’s soul. President Biden, on the other hand, was quick to send his support: “Good on ya, Big Bird. Getting vaccinated is the best way to keep your whole neighborhood safe.” </p><p>Originally funded by a mix of private and public money when it began in 1969, “Sesame Street” now first airs new episodes behind an HBO paywall. Big Bird isn’t a government agent: At best, he’s a victim of the consequences of the Reagan Revolution. At worst, he’s a corporate shill.</p>

            <p>When I read about the Serbian hermit Panta Petrovic this summer, I liked him immediately — even as I understood that he, being a misanthropic hermit, would not like me back. For starters, the man looked the part: 70 years old, smudgy-cheeked and virile, with a beard fanning off him like the bottom of an old broom, rope for a belt and white sleeves blousing from a tattered brown vest. Aesthetically, he resembled a fiddler on the roof without the fiddle. Or the roof.</p><p>Mr. Petrovic lives in a cave. Nearly 20 years ago, he became so aggrieved by society, so irritated by other people’s existence and indignant over the wretchedness of capitalism — “Money is cursed,”<a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210813-serbian-cave-hermit-gets-covid-19-jab-urges-others-to-follow"> </a><a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210813-serbian-cave-hermit-gets-covid-19-jab-urges-others-to-follow">he said</a> — that he left his job as a mechanical engineer, gave away his earnings and moved into a hole in the side of a mountain. And that’s where a journalist from Agence France-Presse found him in August: subsisting mostly on mushrooms and fish, sleeping on hay, peeing and pooping in a rusty bathtub that he’d moved inside his cave (not sure why — plenty of open land outside the cave, you’d assume). His only companions were animals, and his closest one, a pig — a detail that uncannily mirrored one of this year’s most memorable fictional characters, Nicolas Cage’s equally surly hermit in the film “Pig.”</p><p>“She means everything to me,” Mr. Petrovic said of his 440-pound sow. “I love her, and she listens to me.”</p><p>What surprised me was how happy the hermit seemed<em>. </em>More than happy: perfectly content. “Here there is freedom,” he explained to the reporter. “I was not free in the city. There is always someone in your way.”</p><p>Like many people, I was living a fairly hermity existence this time last year. Still, I was alive to the possibility that, once 2020 sputtered into 2021, everything would change. American society would re-emerge from the strange and demoralizing isolation of the Covid pandemic with miraculous new vaccines rushing through its bloodstream instead of the same unruly adrenaline and spite and, as people got back to work, back to school, back to governing ourselves in a somewhat sensible way, under a boring new president, we even had an opportunity to do it all slightly better than before — more equitably, more decently, more joyously — and with heightened appreciation for life lived alongside others.</p><p>It didn’t happen. Instead, this year, even as we tallied the suffering created and exacerbated by a lack of connectedness, from a<a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/drug-overdose-deaths-hit-record-high/"> </a><a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/drug-overdose-deaths-hit-record-high/">record-high number</a> of drug overdose deaths to the academic and social-emotional deficits incurred by kids who couldn’t be physically together in school, it was impossible also not to concentrate on how maddening and horrible connectedness to other human beings can be. Sometimes, it was hard just to stop focusing on the simple reality that other human beings can kill you — and often, it seemed, that they can kill you without much compunction or consequence. They can kill you by refusing to pull their mask over their nostrils, by bureaucratically denying you adequate health care, by allowing you to live on the street, by keeping you at work while a tornado closes in, by shooting you with their guns just because they felt scared.</p><p>Is life better when we’re together? It used to be a question that only hermits bothered to ask. Now it’s a pressing, mainstream concern. Many Americans did bounce through the year ecstatic to be in a community again but only with certain people, people who hadn’t revealed themselves to be morons, jerkwads or fascists. Something about passing through the ordeal of the pandemic seemed to empower people to finally write those other people off. If true cohesion is impossible, it seemed permissible to scale back the project of togetherness by drawing a cozy circle around Us and a bright, flaming line between Us and Them.</p><p>Notably, Mr. Petrovic was newsworthy this summer only because he, too, was momentarily venturing out of his isolation and back into society. And he was doing it for an exquisitely noble purpose: A<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdoVQOIYrAE"> </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdoVQOIYrAE">video captured</a> the cave man, sitting in an antiseptically modern health care facility, rolling up the sleeve of his tunic to receive a Covid-19 vaccine.</p><p>Mr. Petrovic was a solitary and antisocial creature. He had rebuked society with his total being. Still, even he worried that, epidemiologically, he could not sever his relationship to the rest of humanity as cleanly. And if he were to get sick, he explained, no one would be around to take care of him. “I want to get all three doses,” he told the camera. When he was told about vaccine skeptics, his take was: What’s the big fuss? “I urge every citizen to get vaccinated — every single one of them,” he proclaimed. The hermit subsequently reported no significant side effects. “Two or three days later, I was drinking beer normally,” he said.</p><p>The beer comment probably sealed it: The hermit had a moment online.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvucrZHXy6w"> </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvucrZHXy6w">Commenters</a> celebrated him as a hero, bonding around the allure of his lifestyle: a community of introverted, hermit romantics. Others, meanwhile, scoffed at his hypocrisy, dismissing him for carrying on about freedom, then choosing “to inject their bioweapon” into his arm like a dupe. (Mr. Petrovic also receives welfare; no one seemed bothered by this in the comments, though.) Other posts went further, assuming the entire story was nefarious propaganda to promote vaccinations.</p><p>It was the beginnings of something familiar, to the point of being boring: different people mapping their group identities and collective grievances onto the story of someone who wanted nothing to do with groups of people at all. Little arguments about the hermit sprouted between tribes of commenters under the video on YouTube, then branched into unrelated arguments. (Like, does Islam represent the only authoritative and universal truth?) “Open up your chakras and actually connect to other dimensions,” one commenter<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvucrZHXy6w"> </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvucrZHXy6w">told</a> another. “I think the best solution for you is to sit in your garage and let the exhaust run until the fumes take you,” another sniped.</p><p>Two other people, liking the sound of that idea, expressed their solidarity by clicking the tiny thumbs-up.</p><p>*</p><p>Humans have an almost unstoppable propensity to clump ourselves together into groups. We tend to understand this rationally and in flattering terms: It’s our capacity to form a community and feel invested in that community that allows us to work cooperatively and succeed. We tell ourselves that we choose to identify with a particular group because that group is meaningful, productive and right. But fundamentally, banding together may be more of a compulsion than a strategy. There’s something intoxicating about solidarity itself.</p><p>In the early 1970s, the psychologist Henri Tajfel lead a series of studies at the University of Bristol that would become known as “the minimal group experiments.” Dr. Tajfel recruited 64 teenagers from a local school and divided them into groups. In one version, he asked the subjects to estimate how many dots were flashing on a screen, then classified them as either overestimators or underestimators; in another, he showed them two sets of paintings, asked which they preferred, then assigned them to either the Paul Klee group or the Wassily Kandinsky group.</p><p>With these groups established, Dr. Tajfel instructed each person, working in isolation, to allocate money to members of their own group and to members of the other. He was curious whether these “flimsy and unimportant” collective identities, as he called them, would come into play. It seemed unlikely they would.</p><p>Dr. Tajfel was born in 1919 as Hersz Mordche, a Polish Jew, and grew up as antisemitism crusted over the country in the run-up to World War II. (He remembered walking home from school one afternoon as a boy and watching two kids attack two Jewish men on the street, ripping their beards from their faces, drawing blood.) Studying at the Sorbonne when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Dr. Tajfel volunteered to fight for France. When the French surrendered, he was captured and forced to march north alongside other prisoners of war. While he walked, he destroyed his Polish passport and other documents identifying him as a Jew the only way he could: He ate them very slowly.</p><p>Ultimately, Dr. Tajfel learned that his immediate family had perished; almost no one he knew before the war was alive by the end. He was troubled by how readily divisions had sprung up in society and compelled by survivors’ varied emotional responses to the atrocities that followed. He saw some become writers and artists and try to “express and reflect what had happened to them and to others,” he explained at the end of his life. But he knew he didn’t have that talent. He became a psychologist instead.</p><p>With the minimal group experiments, Dr. Tajfel was setting out to investigate the mechanics of intergroup conflict but strove, first, to create a kind of scientific vacuum, untainted by history, stereotypes or prejudices of any kind, so that he could slowly add in variables later and see what happened. That is, these first experiments, with the dots and paintings, weren’t his real experiment. He was just setting up a baseline to get started: groups that were barely even groups, that had been assembled on the spot, based on nothing.</p><p>In fact, Dr. Tajfel’s meaningless, minimal groups were even more meaningless than they appeared. He and his collaborators had actually ignored the kids’ responses to the dots and paintings. Instead, as the social psychologists Dominic J. Packer and Jay J. Van Bavel note, describing these experiments in their new book, “The Power of Us,” “in each case, the researchers had essentially flipped a coin and assigned people to groups based on chance.”</p><p>Still, biases locked in right away. Overwhelmingly, people in Dr. Tajfel’s experiment gave more of the money he put at their disposal to members of their own group than the other. Moreover, they were bent on creating as large a disparity as possible, even when offered the option of maximizing the amount of money for everyone, at no cost. Their behavior seemed vindictive, “a clear case of gratuitous discrimination,” Dr. Tajfel wrote.</p><p>Since then, other researchers have run their own minimal group experiments, pushing those findings further. Dr. Packer and Dr. Van Bavel have split people into leopards and tigers, for example. Others have gone maximally minimal and divided people into group A and group B. Still, the pride — the readiness to connect — is always there. When you tell people they’re in group A, Dr. Packer says, those people are reliably psyched to be in group A. Stick leopard people in a brain imaging machine and show them a picture of a stranger, and their brain activity changes if they know that the stranger is a leopard person, too. Their positivity toward other leopard people increases and even supersedes racial biases that cut the other way.</p><p>Dr. Packer and Dr. Van Bavel call the minimal group studies “among the most important studies in the history of psychology.” They demonstrate that “the human sense of self — your gravitational center — does not stay in the same place. With a flip of a coin, people constructed entirely new identities in a matter of minutes.”</p><p>The rewards of this kind of connectedness wind up driving all kinds of wonderful human behavior, sometimes less obviously than we’d assume. What initially piqued my interest in this whole phenomenon was a conversation with Mark Snyder, a University of Minnesota psychologist who has studied volunteerism in America since the mid-1980s, when he started observing volunteers caring for people with AIDS. I asked Dr. Snyder why people spend their time helping others; every year Americans spend<a href="https://causeinspiredmedia.com/google-ads/the-value-of-volunteers/"> </a><a href="https://causeinspiredmedia.com/google-ads/the-value-of-volunteers/">roughly eight billion hours</a> volunteering — an estimated more than $200 billion worth of labor, all given for free. He started by pointing out that “we’re socialized to believe that charity is selfless, that it shouldn’t feel good,” but that this is a myth. Dr. Snyder’s research demonstrates that the volunteers who stick with their volunteerism the longest are those who transcend some narrowly altruistic motivation and enjoy the inevitable, more self-interested rewards they’re reaping in the process as well.</p><p>And one of the key ones is human connectedness: Volunteering creates friendships, expands social networks and gives volunteers a greater feeling of belonging to the other volunteers and their communities at large. It’s a feedback loop, Dr. Snyder explained, an unwittingly virtuous cycle. The stronger those bonds get, the more rewarding the volunteer work becomes for the volunteers and the more committed they’ll be.</p><p>Still, Dr. Snyder added, this phenomenon is morally neutral. Togetherness is a fissile material; we can’t necessarily predict or control what reaction it will set off. “The process that leads individuals to take action — fulfilling their own motivations, connecting with other people with a shared sense of community — these processes work whether we approve or disapprove of the ends to which they’re ultimately put,” Dr. Snyder said. The group of volunteers who spend their Saturday working at a Covid vaccination clinic and the group of volunteers who spend their Saturday protesting outside the clinic are, psychologically speaking, riding the same wave. Each effort is sustainable, he explained, “because the ends are usually seen as valuable and moral in the eyes of the people working toward them.”</p><p>That drive seems even more profound during a disaster. Sociologists have long observed the formation of emergent groups — ad hoc, self-organizing communities of volunteers that spontaneously arise to address specific problems during natural disasters. These volunteers might search for victims in the rubble of a collapsed building or get on social media to systematize the dissemination of information about missing people. Disasters are disruptions, cleaving ordinary life open into vacuums of uncertainty. Falling into a community with others — particularly a community acting with purpose — helps people regain certainty and agency. In a catastrophe, taking action can feel restorative, euphoric even, and seems to help sustain survivors’ mental health.</p><p>It’s worth noting, since it may not feel that way every second of every day, that if you’re reading this, you are surviving a disaster — a horrific one but one that’s also curiously disorienting and abstract. More than five million people have died, but there haven’t always been obvious piles of rubble for the rest of us to run toward or completely satisfying ways to reclaim our agency or offer help. I don’t know how an mRNA vaccine works, for example, and, though I did sometimes wonder or even worry about their safety, I ultimately just trusted the scientific community that told me to stick one in my arm.</p><p>Imagine, under these circumstances, a group of people who rush forward to help but are given bad information by the people they trust — or even misinformation that they can’t disprove or aren’t savvy enough to question or just aren’t motivated to contradict. Maybe they’re told the rubble pile is to the east instead of west or that it’s a tsunami that’s coming instead of a fire. Imagine how unproductively they would wind up reacting. They might set off running to help in exactly the wrong direction and just keep running — for months or years, as long as the disaster lasted. Even if, objectively, their running didn’t seem to accomplish very much, they would be running as a group, which feels better than doing nothing alone.</p><p>How would you ever stop these people from running? How would you call them back?</p><p>*</p><p>“I’ve never seen antisocial behavior at scale in my lifetime in the United States,” Scott Gabriel Knowles told me, “never seen it raised up to the level of mainstream politics. It’s been really startling.”</p><p>Dr. Knowles is a historian and professor at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology — an American who has studied disasters for 20 years. He explained that the academic literature of disasters talks about emergent groups primarily as prosocial: people coming together to help their neighbors. And overwhelmingly, that’s been the reality.</p><p>But on Jan. 6, he turned on his television and saw an emergent group there, too — a community of grossly misinformed, if not willfully misinformed, insurrectionists who, although they had been unmistakably riled up by an authority figure at the rally beforehand, were now storming the Capitol as a self-organizing group of volunteers. “I can’t deconstruct the psychology of each one of those people,” Dr. Knowles explained. But it was clear to him from some of their own statements that many were part of “a community that’s reacting to something they see as a bigger disaster than Covid: the Black Lives Matter protests.” That is, they were responding to a perceived emergency, persuaded that they were the ones who had to get the job done. (“If you don’t fight like hell,” the about-to-be-former president had<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/10/966396848/read-trumps-jan-6-speech-a-key-part-of-impeachment-trial"> </a><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/10/966396848/read-trumps-jan-6-speech-a-key-part-of-impeachment-trial">told them</a>, “you’re not going to have a country anymore.”)</p><p>“These are groups of people who’ve done exactly what the literature said they should do,” Dr. Knowles conceded, “as much as I find it totally distasteful. If people feel that their group is in danger or that a disaster has occurred, they will take action in innovative ways.” It’s hard to imagine more antisocial behavior than attempting to undo a democratic election with mayhem and violence. But the insurrectionists were doing it together, and pretty joyously, it seemed — snapping selfies, posting them to Facebook with stupid jokes in real time. It was, within their community, a prosocial activity, too. They were like anti-hermits who, feeling the same hyperbolic disgruntlement and repulsion about where society was heading, had all found one another instead of each finding a cave.</p><p>Remember Podium Guy? Adam Johnson is the 36-year-old man who had traveled to Washington from Florida and was<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/11/22/pelosi-lectern-defendant-guilty-plea/"> </a><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/11/22/pelosi-lectern-defendant-guilty-plea/">photographed</a> strolling through the chaos in the Capitol Rotunda cradling Nancy Pelosi’s stolen lectern in one arm. There was nothing benign about him; he was part of a rampage. But alone at the center of the photo, waving at the camera and grinning widely, he had the bemused but cheerful expression of a roadie loading out after a crazy gig.</p><p>Last month, after Mr. Johnson pleaded guilty to “entering or remaining in any restricted building,” a federal judge, Reggie B. Walton, explained that he was considering sending Mr. Johnson to prison: “You seemed to have thought it was a fun event to be involved in,” Judge Walton<a href="https://www.bradenton.com/news/local/crime/article256031662.html"> </a><a href="https://www.bradenton.com/news/local/crime/article256031662.html">scolded</a> Podium Guy from the bench. But he did more than scold. He addressed Mr. Johnson almost as a kind of empty vessel, a weak-willed receiver and amplifier of other people’s energies — a completely impressionable sucker for the feeling of being in a group. “You were gullible enough to come all the way up here from Florida based upon a lie and then associate yourself, because of that lie, with people and try to undermine the will of the American public,” the<a href="https://www.bradenton.com/news/local/crime/article256031662.html"> </a><a href="https://www.bradenton.com/news/local/crime/article256031662.html">judge insisted</a>. And those other people are still out there, still promulgating the same lie. “So why shouldn’t I lock you up, sir? Why should I think that you won’t do this again?”</p><p>I have no answer to the problem of Podium Guys — how, on a societal level, to stop manufacturing them or to neutralize the destructive potential of the ones who already exist. It’s depressing to recognize that community, a powerful tool for solving our most intractable problems, can be a powerful incubator and accelerant of problems, too. And it’s extra-depressing because those problems keep multiplying and inflating. Even aside from the pandemic, there’s enough confusion and precariousness in our country, real and imagined and from the scale of individual families to the planetary level, to make any given day feel like a crisis, too. When a system appears to be malfunctioning, indifferent, reckless or corrupt, that’s a kind of disaster, and people are likely to come together and respond, for better or worse.</p><p>Some will be volunteers, and some will be vigilantes. But both may be reacting to a similar feeling of free fall, of tumbling. This doesn’t make them morally equivalent; in the end, morality is what <em>keeps</em> them from being equivalent. I know it’s important to keep drawing that distinction, to keep calling it out. I also know it’s not enough.</p>
